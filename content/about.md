> My name is Liang Li. I am studying master degree in East China Normal University (ECNU). my research interests include **cryptography, attribute-based encryption and blockchain-based crowdsourcing.** This is my first site. I've wanted to create a site for a long time, but I didn't realize it due to laziness. In this site, I will record my life for myself (when my memory fails me). Hope I can keep going.

### My Hobbies (keep changing):
- Alone in a daze
- Close to nature
- Fiction (e.g., )
- *Romance of the Three Kingdoms*
- ......
