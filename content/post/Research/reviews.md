# Review 1
- Are there any particular privacy requirements related to fine-grained crowdsensing? Why is this setting important? Furthermore, would it be better to demonstrate the performance of fine-grained crowdsensing task matching with the proposed method?
- It is unclear how fine-grained crowdsensing task-matching performance is.

- It is unclear how the method would work in the **real-world** scenario. 
> 引言的描述是否太抽象？


# Review 2
- Compared to VP2-Match, it is slower in task encryption and trapdoor generation
- A more thorough discussion on whether the computational burden on clients could become a bottleneck or if the gains on the crowdsourcing server’s side can offset these client-side costs would improve the paper.

# Review 4
- The problem investigated by the authors seems quite artificial.
- The originality of the approach is not very clear.
- The authors present some possible privacy issues in the introduction, but these examples are not very convincing, nor really detailed. I must say that I struggled to find these problems realistic, and crowsourcing itself seems an idea which never really caught up in practice.
